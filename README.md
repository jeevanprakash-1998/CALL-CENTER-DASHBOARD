# CALL-CENTER-DASHBOARD
This project involves the creation of an interactive Call Center Performance Dashboard using Microsoft Excel. The primary goal of this dashboard is to provide a comprehensive and easily digestible overview of key call center operational metrics, enabling management and stakeholders to monitor performance, identify trends, and make informed 
Key Objectives:

To track and visualize critical call center KPIs to assess overall performance.
To analyze customer interaction data to identify areas for improvement in service delivery.
To monitor agent performance and workload distribution.
To gain insights into call reasons and customer contact patterns.
Potential Dashboard Components and Key Insights (Inferred from sheet names):

1. Data (XCALL CENTER DASHBOARD EXCEL.xlsx - Data.csv):
* This sheet likely serves as the raw data source for the entire dashboard. It would contain detailed records of individual calls, including information such as:
* Call ID
* Date and Time of Call
* Agent ID
* Customer ID
* Call Duration
* Call Status (e.g., Answered, Abandoned, Resolved)
* Call Reason/Category
* Wait Time
* Customer Sentiment (if tracked)

2. Customer Centre Report (XCALL CENTER DASHBOARD EXCEL.xlsx - Customer Centre Report.csv):
* This sheet probably presents aggregated or summarized data focusing on customer interactions and experience. It might include:
* Service Level: Percentage of calls answered within a target time.
* Abandonment Rate: Percentage of callers who hang up before reaching an agent.
* Average Speed of Answer (ASA): Average time a caller waits before being connected to an agent.
* Average Handle Time (AHT): Average duration of a call, including talk time, hold time, and after-call work.
* First Call Resolution (FCR) Rate: Percentage of customer issues resolved on the first contact.
* Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) Scores: If collected, a summary of customer feedback.
* Call volume trends by hour, day, or week.
* Breakdown of call reasons by category.

3. Pivots (XCALL CENTER DASHBOARD EXCEL.xlsx - Pivots.csv):
* This sheet likely contains various PivotTables and PivotCharts built from the 'Data' sheet. These pivots would facilitate dynamic analysis and enable users to:
* Analyze agent performance (e.g., calls handled per agent, AHT per agent, resolution rates).
* Break down call volumes and metrics by specific time periods (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
* Filter data by call reason, customer segment, or agent team.
* Compare performance across different shifts or teams.
* Identify peak call times and staffing needs.

Technologies Used:

Microsoft Excel: Utilized for data storage, cleaning, transformation (using formulas, Power Query if applicable), creation of PivotTables and PivotCharts, and dashboard design using Excel's built-in charting and formatting capabilities. This allows for an easily shareable and widely accessible dashboard for users familiar with Excel.
This Excel-based dashboard provides a practical tool for call center managers to monitor operational efficiency, identify areas for improvement in customer service, and optimize resource allocation without requiring specialized business intelligence software.
